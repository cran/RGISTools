\title{Mosaic a set of MODIS images}
\usage{
modMosaic(src, AppRoot, extent = NULL, out.name = "outfile",
  verbose = FALSE, gutils = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{src}{the path of the folder with the MODIS images in GTiff format.}

\item{AppRoot}{the directory where the mosaicked images are saved.}

\item{extent}{an \code{extent}, \code{Raster*}, or \code{Spatial*} object
representing the region of interest.}

\item{out.name}{the name of the folder that stores the outputs. By default,
“outfile” is assigned.}

\item{verbose}{logical argument. If \code{TRUE}, the function prints the 
running steps and warnings.}

\item{gutils}{logical argument. If \code{TRUE}, the function uses `GDAL' 
utilities for mosaicking.}

\item{overwrite}{logical argument. If \code{TRUE}, overwrites the existing 
images with the same name.}

\item{...}{arguments for nested functions:
 \itemize{
  \item \code{pathrow} a \code{list} of vectors with the path and row numbers
  of the tiles concerning the region of interest.
  \item \code{bFilter} a vector with the bands to be mosaicked. If not
  supplied, all bands are mosaicked.
  \item \code{dayFilter} a vector with the capturing dates being considered
  for mosaicking. If not supplied, all dates are mosaicked.
}}
}
\description{
\code{modMosaic} merges the MODIS imagery that covers a 
region of interest on the same dates.
}
\details{
The function mosaics the imagery in the \code{src} folder. The folder can
hold GTiff images from several tiles, dates and bands. When only a subset
of bands or dates has to be mosaicked, the band names or dates should be
provided through the argument \code{bFilter} or \code{dayFilter}. Band
names are defined by the letter “b” and the two-digit band number (e.g., 
‘b01’). The dates must be provided as a \code{Date} class object. Once
mosaicked, the images can be cropped to fit the \code{extent} (optional).
The \code{extent} can be defined in any coordinate reference system, since
\code{modMosaic} automatically reproject the extent to match the projection
of the image. The outputs will be placed in the \code{AppRoot} directory,
under the folder named as \code{out.name}. If no name is provided, the 
folder is named “outfile”. To use \code{gutils = TRUE}, a proper installation
of `GDAL' is required. This method is faster than the native `R' functions.
